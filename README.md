# 🌟 Chasen Jeffries' Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website! I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you. Check out the live version [here](https://chasen-jeffries.github.io/).

## 📖 About the Project

This website is a canvas for my ideas, a portfolio of my work, and a way to connect with like-minded individuals. It's always a work in progress, as I believe in continuous learning and improvement.

### 🚀 Initial Template

A big shoutout to Zirafa for their [Simple Website Template](https://github.com/cplmakerlab/simple-website-template) on GitHub. It provided a solid foundation to start with and allowed me to focus on customizing and adding my personal touch.

### 🎨 My Customizations

Check out my [updated template](https://github.com/Chasen-Jeffries/Website_Template) to see how I've transformed the initial template into something uniquely mine. I've added new features, tweaked the design, and made it more reflective of my personal style and the content I want to share.
