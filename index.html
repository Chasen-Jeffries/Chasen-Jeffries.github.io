              <p>
               Chasen Jeffries was raised in the beautiful Appalachian mountains, nestled on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina,
               where he developed a deep appreciation for the outdoors and nurtured his dream of becoming a professional soccer player.
                In 2019, Chasen earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in History from High Point University. During his undergraduate studies, 
                he explored a variety of historical topics, with a particular emphasis on modern European and Asian history.
                Shortly after completing his undergraduate degree, Chasen joined Red 5 Security as a researcher and analyst. 
                In this role, he conducted dynamic open source research, working diligently to achieve client objectives in a fast-paced environment.
                In the fall of 2021, Chasen embarked on his journey to pursue a graduate degree at Claremont Graduate University, 
                where he is currently immersing himself in the realms of International Political Economy and Computation Analytics.

                  <strong><a href="https://github.com/Chasen-Jeffries/Electoral-Systems-Outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electoral Systems Simulation:</a> </strong>
                  The Electoral Systems Outcomes Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulates how different voting systemsâ€”majoritarian, proportional representation, ranked-choice voting, and mixed-member proportionalâ€”affect electoral outcomes, 
                   using agents to represent voters, candidates, and parties across multiple policy dimensions. 
                   This simulation aims to demonstrate the impact of electoral system design on voter representation and government policy formation, emphasizing that identical voter populations can yield divergent results under different systems, thereby providing a platform for comparative analysis and informed discussions on electoral reform and democracy.

                    "Dynamics of Olson's Model: An ABM Exploration" is a NetLogo simulation that investigates Mancur Olson's theory on roving and stationary bandits to understand wealth distribution and governance's impact on society. 
                   Through a detailed Agent-Based Model (ABM), the simulation presents scenarios that vividly depict bandit behavior under various conditions, thereby offering insights into the interactions between governance, the economy, 
                   and societal welfare based on Olson's distinct categorization of bandits and their strategic decisions.
